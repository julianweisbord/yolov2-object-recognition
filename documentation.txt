Create Dataset:
The first step in this software pipeline is to download a bunch of random images to serve as the background images
and then a series of time magazine cover images to randomly overlay onto the background images. This could be
done with a script to scrape images but I decided to use the Fatkun Batch Download Image Chrome extension to make
the process quicker. The Time magazine covers that I downloaded came from the following google searches: "Time Magazine Cover",
"Time Magazine", "Old Time Magazine", and "History Time Magazine Covers." The background images came from the following
Google searches: "Cool Cars", "Outdoor Activities", and "Images."
Next overlay time magazine to a random position on the background image
Next draw a box around all Time magazine covers

Train YOLOv2 on Time Magazine Covers:
The assessment suggested to use Keras or Cafe with darknet but I like tensorflow
so I chose to use darkflow (https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow)

Classify and detect location of Time Magazine covers
